# World_Weather_Analysis
This challenge was meant to test my abilities to use API's with python. I was tasked to create travel plans for a client's weather preferences. I was able to collect weather data using APIs, filter out vacation locations based on current weather conditions, and create a suggested travel itinerary for them all using python programming.
